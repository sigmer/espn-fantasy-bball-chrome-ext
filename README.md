# ESPN Fantasy Basketball Chrome Plugin

In a neverending quest to destroy the usability of their website, ESPN overhauled the UI for their fantasy league pages. This extension aims to address some styling quirks to hopefully provide an overall better experience.

Changes:
* Adjust the width of the table showing player stats to prevent the need to horizontally scroll
* Removed the gray gutters
* Tweaked some container borders
